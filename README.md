# parprog-assignments

Assignments done for a Parallel Programming course [UFMS Faculty of Computing](https://facom.ufms.br), Brazil.

## Description

These assignments are organized one per subdirectory, namely

1. `router`: an OpenMP-based solution to trace routing with Lee's algorithm.
1. `min-edit-distance`: a CUDA-based solution to minimum edit distance between two genetic sequences.
1. `erase-zeros`: an MPI-based parallel solution to filtering of large arrays.

Each project has a PDF file that describes it (in Portuguese).
